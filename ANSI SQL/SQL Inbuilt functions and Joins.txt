Sorting Operator in SQL:
Order By

Syntax: Order by Column_name ASC/DESC
Note: The default order is ASC

Filtering clauses:
(i) Conditional operators: > < >= <= =(Equality) <>(Not equal)
i=10
a=b
(ii) Range operator: Between , Not Between
eg: salary between 100 to 200

(iii) List Operator: IN , Not IN
eg: state IN('Chennai')

(iv) String Operator: Like , Not Like
This operator uses % wild card character to search based on beginning or ending letter
eg: name like('s%')   sam samuel
name like ('%s')  gomes games

(v) Nullable operator: Is Null ,   Is Not Null


Case Statements in SQL:
This statements provide if else condition in result set

example
case
when number%2=0 Then 'Even'
when number%2<>0 Then 'odd'
end



Joins: These are mechanisms to display data from one or more tables based on primary-
foreign key matching conditions.

(i) Inner Join : These will be joining 2 or more tables for display provided same data exist
between joining tables.

(ii) Outer Join:
(a) Left Outer Join:Displays all records from the table present in left side of join keyword;
From right table if there are matching records they are displayed.[If the left table
does not have matching record in right table they are displayed as null].
(b) Right Outer Join:vise-versa


(iii) Self Join: Where joining condition is applied within the same table


Distinct Keyword: This is used to give single data from redundant result set

Coalesce() or ifnull(): Checks whether there is any null value; if null value found
replaces it with another column data or string literal only for display.

String APIs or Functions():
(i) Upper(): converts data to upper case
(ii)Lower(): converts data to lower case
(iii) concat(): joins 2 string values
(iv) cast(): changes numberic data to char data
(v) substring(column_name,starting_index,length(optional)): extracts part of string from main string
(vi) left(column_name,length): extracts data starting from left side upto given length
[ie always extraction starts from left side 0 index]
(vii)right(column_name,length): vice-versa
(viii) Length(): extracts length of string
(ix) TRIM(): Removes spaces from left and right of data


DateTime APIs or functions:
(i) now(): displays current date and time
(ii) curdate(): displays current date only
(iii)curtime(): displays current time only
(iv)Extract(datepart from date value)
example: Extract(month from joining_date_column)
(v)Month(): Extracts month from date
(vi)Year():Extracts year
(vii)Day():Extracts day from date
(viii) monthname(): used to extract month value in string format
(ix) date_diff(): displays interval (in days) between 2 date values
(x)date_add(): adds interval to date values
(xi) date_format(): displays date value into client specified format
Note: The default date value in mysql is yyyy-MM-dd

Aggregate Functions : 
Max()
Min()
Sum()
Avg() 
Count()

Group By Clause: Works with aggregate functions to group similar data values for result
Having Clause is used in a query which has group by clause to filter aggregate result

Round(data,decimals to be rounded)
round(1.3478,2)=1.35

Subquery:
It is one select statement under another select statement.
Subquery contains 2 parts:
(i) Inner Select which is for decision making
(ii) Outer Select which is for output

Outer select will provide output depending upon what is returned by inner select.

Subquery Operators:
(i) Comaprision Operator
(ii) IN , Not IN
(iii) AND , ANY
